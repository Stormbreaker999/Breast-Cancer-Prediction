# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Branch to master for environment files along with project files

The algorithm uses Support Vector Machine to classify a tuple with four parameters to classify it as Benign(0) or Malignant(1).
The four employed features are-
1- Radius Mean
2- Texture Mean
3- Perimeter Mean
4- Area Mean

run 'python main.py' and use y/n for option for retraining or using already trained model to predict on an input.
Sample input-
Radius Mean = 15
Texture Mean = 16
Perimeter Mean=18
Area Mean = 640
